	<h2>13C: Urbanization in an Era of Capitalism</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urbanization</strong> - the increase in the percentage of people who live within cities<ul>
<li>Cities may expand but may not necessarily be experiencing urbanization</li>
<li>Cities originally supported elite class through taxes of the much larger rural population</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Situation</strong> - the way in which a particular place relates to the space that surrounds it<ul>
<li>Large hinterlands surrounding the cities could import goods from the farms</li>
<li>Cities exercised control over the empires<ul>
<li>Built canals, controlled sea lanes, and developed road networks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Capitalist cities emerged in Europe which relied on commerce more than control of political leaders<ul>
<li>Access to the markets was the central consideration </li>
<li>Economic activity no longer required a strong centralized government</li>
<li>These new cities helped to form <strong>urban networks</strong><ul>
<li>Cities that are tied together in some meaningful way</li>
<li><strong>functional linkages</strong> - the meaningful ties between cities in an urban network that were historically political and administrative<ul>
<li>Based on trade</li>
<li>Located on trading routes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hanseatic League</strong><ul>
<li>Gave shelter to out of town merchants, and various aide to conducting trade</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>13D: Industrial Cities</h2>
<ul>
<li>A new type of economy was required for any large scale urbanization to occur<ul>
<li>Capitalism could not do this alone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Industrialization</strong><ul>
<li>Labor required to run factories; factories required raw materials and a market</li>
<li>Agriculture became more efficient<ul>
<li>Provide labor in factories and provide food for new <strong>urbanites</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cities could now access a wider range of raw materials thanks to better transportation</li>
<li>Four major effects of industrialization<ul>
<li>Allowed cities to grow tremendously</li>
<li>Enabled proliferation of cities</li>
<li>Led to more concentrated settlement patterns</li>
<li>Altered logic of urban location</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Concentration of labor</strong> <ul>
<li>Required by factory systems</li>
<li>Resulted from forms of <strong>mass production</strong><ul>
<li>Favored concentrated settlement in some places</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Factory owners created cheap living quarters for workers<ul>
<li>40,000 people per building</li>
<li>8 per room</li>
<li>30 to a toilet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>13F: Urbanization Patterns around the World</h2>
<ul>
<li>Over half of current population lives in cities</li>
<li>Developed countries have about 70% of residents living in cities, while less developed countries have a smaller portion<ul>
<li>Most less developed countries are experiencing rapid rural to urban movement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Urbanization corresponds with economic development <ul>
<li>Wealthier countries are more likely to undergo transformations that cause rural to urban migration because they may enjoy a more dynamic economy</li>
<li>Peculiarities<ul>
<li>India is large but has low urban percentage</li>
<li>Latin America has high urban percentage but lacks economic development</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Urbanization does <strong>not</strong> equal population density<ul>
<li>Bangladesh and the Netherlands are dense but have low urban percentage</li>
<li>Canada and Libya have sparse populations but have high urban percentage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>13G: Agglomeration Economics and Urban Functions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agglomeration economies</strong> <ul>
<li>Different economic activities tend to locate next to each other and act as a powerful magnet, attracting other activities</li>
<li>Includes factories, infrastructure, and services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New cities included<ul>
<li>Suppliers to provide essential materials</li>
<li>Transportation facilities</li>
<li>Access to financial services</li>
<li>Production services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relationship between city and hinterland became complicated as industries could begin to sell only to local residents as they grew</li>
<li><strong>Urban functions</strong><ul>
<li>Specialized functions taken on by cities as a result of interurban networks</li>
<li>Wealthiest and most integrated regions</li>
<li>American Manufacturing Belt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some functions of cities are more heavily promoted In certain cities<ul>
<li>LA is center of film and television industry</li>
<li>Las Vegas - tourism and conventions</li>
<li>Boston - colleges and universities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
