<h2><a id="Why_do_people_migrate_1"></a>Why do people migrate?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ernst Georg Ravenstein
<ul>
<li>British geographer in the 1880s</li>
<li>Came up with 6 laws of migration in a paper in 1885</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ravenstein’s laws
<ul>
<li>Most migrants travel only a short distance and toward major cities or industrial areas
<ul>
<li>Centers of absorption</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As migrants move toward these centers of absorption, they leave gaps, which are filled by migrants from farther away
<ul>
<li>Flow from more remote to less remote areas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flows of migration also create counter flows that take people away from the cities, but in less numbers
<ul>
<li>Become too crowded in cities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Long-distance migrants are more likely to be heading to a major cities</li>
<li>Urban residents are less likely to migrate than are people who live in the country</li>
<li>Women migrate more than men, but they tend to migrate shorter distances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distance decay
<ul>
<li>More interaction among places that are closer than far away is expected</li>
<li>Known as Zipf’s Law</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gravity model
<ul>
<li>Interaction between two cities is a function of the population of the two cities and the distance between them; two large cities will have more interaction than a large and small city</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step migration
<ul>
<li>Instead of moving far away, migrants will move close to home, then farther way, and so on until they reach their final destination</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everett Lee
<ul>
<li>1996, came up with push pull model of migration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intervening obstacles
<ul>
<li>Variables that a migrant must consider when weighing the pluses and minuses of a potential move</li>
<li>Cost, difficulties of crossing borders and obtaining visas, psychological difficulties of breaking ties with friends and family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Life cycle
<ul>
<li>People are more likely to migrate at critical times in their life</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intervening opportunities
<ul>
<li>Amount of migration movement between two places, A and B, is affected by the number of other possible migration destination that a migrant leaving A can choose from before reaching B</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Factor mobility model
<ul>
<li>Model that argues that differences in wage rates cause people to migrate from low wage areas to high wage areas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human capital model
<ul>
<li>People move not just for macroeconomic reasons but also for individual reasons</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Consequences_of_Migration_37"></a>Consequences of Migration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Large numbers of migrants can lead to significant challenges for receiving or sending areas
<ul>
<li>Housing demands could not keep up with migration in 1830-40s New York City</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequences can be categorized as demographic, economic, or social</li>
<li>Demographic consequences
<ul>
<li>When migrants change the basic structure of a population</li>
<li>US pop. Is increasingly Hispanic and Asian because of immigrants from Latin America and Asia
<ul>
<li>Population expected to triple by 2050</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Economic consequences
<ul>
<li>Can be positive or negative</li>
<li>Population levels in Europe rose in Industrial Revolution, migrants were welcomed in US and Canada relieved strain on European society</li>
<li>Undocumented workers
<ul>
<li>Some anti-immigration groups’ studies: Illegal immigrants cost Arizona over $2 billion a year in health care, education, lost taxes, and public services</li>
<li>Advocates counter saying government benefits from the taxes immigrants pay and the benefits of companies to hire cheap labor</li>
<li>2010, debate grew as Arizona tried harder to identify illegal immigrants</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Migrants can bring skills to their country
<ul>
<li>In US, rural areas, small towns, and poor urban areas rely on foreign trained doctors and nurses willing to work for less than normal, although higher than in their home country</li>
<li>Special visas allow migrants to remain in country longer than normal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social consequences
<ul>
<li>Migration brings one group of people in contact with another</li>
<li>Brings both better cultural understanding and discord</li>
<li>Know nothings
<ul>
<li>Many New-Yorkers were anti-Irish, considering their English origin</li>
<li>Residents also anti-Catholic.
<ul>
<li>Irish immigrants mistrusted, hated, given jobs too dangerous for slaves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1840s Know-Nothing party rose to power in Boston with strong anti-Irish agenda
<ul>
<li>Held many positions</li>
<li>Leaders implemented anti-Irish laws, such as forcing students to read from Protestant King James Bible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>San Francisco, two Irish immigrants lynched</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cuban Chinese restaurants
<ul>
<li>United States Chinese Exclusion Act banned Chinese laborers from country, 1882</li>
<li>Immigrants went to other countries such as Cuba and other Latin American countries
<ul>
<li>Chinese already in America started to leave because of growing anti-Chinese sentiment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communist revolution in 1959 (Fidel Castro)
<ul>
<li>Chinese fled to America, most popularly New York with its Chinatown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chinese had by this time adopted Latin and Caribbean culture, language, and food</li>
<li>Several Cuban-Chinese Restaurants remain today</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
