<h2><a id="Territoriality_0"></a>Territoriality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most institutions use the subdivision of territory to administer and govern effectively
<ul>
<li>Overall territory is divided into <strong>political subunits</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Territory is used to as a means to manipulate space and make the administration of the institution more efficient</li>
<li>3 positives to subunits
<ol>
<li>Efficiency
<ul>
<li>Managing a large territory is difficult</li>
<li>Locating where problems occur can be made easier with subunits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flexibility
<ul>
<li>Different units may require varying degrees of administration</li>
<li>Dividing them into smaller spatial units provides flexibility</li>
<li>Ie. Government establishing different languages within different regions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Responsiveness
<ul>
<li>Administration is able to respond to separate problems within each subunit</li>
<li>A governor can respond to a county’s issue better than the US President</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>2 negatives to subunits
<ol>
<li>Subunits restrict access to certain people
<ul>
<li>Movement between districts may be strictly controlled</li>
<li>Markers are made between territories to act as barriers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mismatch between scope and effectiveness of solving a problem
<ul>
<li>Results from proliferation of subunits</li>
<li>A certain problem may be best handled by a higher level of administration, but the tools required to address the issue are only available to local government or institution</li>
<li>Land use should be handled by government, zoning is only available to local jurisdictions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Territorial development of the Roman Catholic Church
<ul>
<li>Early church communities did not want to adapt the kind of structure seen in the Jewish religion</li>
<li>Establishing territories was difficult because Catholicism was still illegal in Rome</li>
<li>When Roman Empire adopted the religion, the territorial protocol changed dramatically
<ul>
<li>The changes remained after the state fell</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The pope appoints bishops over territories called diocese and archdiocese
<ul>
<li>Global territories were easier to manage but also brought bureaucratic and hierarchical structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
