          <h2><a id="Palm_Sunday_0"></a>Palm Sunday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sunder before Easter
<ul>
<li>Jesus accompanied by his disciples entered Jerusalem in triumph; enthusiastic crowd spread palms on the road and hailed Jesus as the “Son of David”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Tridduum_Three_Days_4"></a>Tridduum (Three Days)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Matthew, Mark, and Luke focus on the institution of the Lord’s Supper; John focuses on the final teachings of Jesus, including the washing of the feet</li>
<li>Altar is removed of everything and prepared for Good Friday - symbolic of a tomb slab</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Good_Friday_9"></a>Good Friday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Marked by silence - no mass is celebrated</li>
<li>Meditations centered on Christ’s seven last phrases</li>
<li>Peculiar to English  language (German word meaning mourning); could be lost in translation from God’s Friday to Good Friday (no tragedy, not even death,  can overwhelm God’s providence, love and grace)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="7_last_phrases_14"></a>7 last phrases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Father, forgive them for they know not what they do</li>
<li>Today you will be with me in paradise</li>
<li>Woman, behold your son</li>
<li>My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?</li>
<li>I thirst</li>
<li>It is  finished</li>
<li>Father into your hands I commend my spirits</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="How_was_Jesus_death_different_23"></a>How was Jesus’ death different</h2>
<ul>
<li>Crown of thorns</li>
<li>Whipping</li>
<li>Carried his cross (close to 200 pounds; probably  1 mile up a slight incline)</li>
<li>Wood was rough (like a telephone pole)</li>
<li>Given hyssop (mulled wine that created dry mouth)</li>
<li>Nailed to cross as opposed to being tied</li>
<li>Nailed through wrists not palms (palms could not bear the weight)</li>
<li>Did not have a foot rest</li>
<li>Side was pierced with a lance</li>
<li>Death was quick (3 hours as opposed to 3 days)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Holy_Saturday_35"></a>Holy Saturday</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paschal Candle is lit</li>
<li>Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (Baptism for converts) is part of this celebration</li>
<li>Alleluia is reinstated</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Resurrection_40"></a>Resurrection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explanation of empty tomb
<ul>
<li>Jesus was unconscious</li>
<li>Women went to wrong tomb</li>
<li>Thieves stole Jesus’ body</li>
<li>Disciples stole Jesus’ body</li>
<li>Religious leaders stole Jesus’ body</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence against
<ul>
<li>Roman soldier told Pilate he was dead; side pierced with a lance; body wrapped and placed in tomb</li>
<li>Mary Magdalene and Jesus’ mother saw him placed in tomb; Peter went to same tomb</li>
<li>Tomb was sealed and guarded by soldiers</li>
<li>Disciples were ready to die for their  faith - stealing the body would have been admitting their faith was meaningless
Religious leaders would have produced the body to stop rumors of the resurrection</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
